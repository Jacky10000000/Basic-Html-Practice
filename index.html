<body>
    <h2>Chucks Casual Stroll</h2>


    <p>I was always a big fan of walks, especially in them big cities. My Lungs sure don't like'em however don't know what's their issue however when it comes to my eyes it's a different story.
        The bustling streets with horseless carriages and boots and loafers stomping on them sidewalks, tophats, boaters, and fedoras all around my goodness.
